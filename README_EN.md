# Sharing The Experience of <DevOps Capability Maturity Certification>

Our team started participating in the “DevOps Capability Maturity” certification work in 2019 and achieved some results while also identifying areas for improvement. The purpose of the text is to record the team’s participation in the rating process, including information related to documents, tools, processes, strengths, and weaknesses. The main goal is to share the problems encountered and solutions found during the certification process and to welcome contributions from others’ experiences. The hope is that this information can help other teams smoothly complete the certification work.

Here you will find the following information: 
   1) Background of the DevOps Capability Maturity certification project, including certification background, standard requirements, and relevant contextual details.
   2) DevOps tool set encompassing system architecture, tool sources, installation procedures, operational guidelines, and maintenance practices - all utilizing open source tools.
   3) DevOps processes comprising process classification aligned with the maturity model, process description documents, and corresponding outputs (including templates).
   4) DevOps culture encompassing methodologies and experiences.
   5) Rating certification process insights along with experiences encountered during implementation phase as well as identified deficiencies and their respective solutions.
   6) Demo (under construction).

The maturity of a DevOps project relies not only on tools and processes but also on continuous improvement efforts. We have endeavored to showcase all aspects of the DevOps process through a Demo project; however, this is an arduous task. It is inevitable that there may be certain shortcomings in the initial stages of development. We hope for your understanding and support while also encouraging you to contribute your knowledge and experience towards collectively maintaining this exemplary project. Thank you!
